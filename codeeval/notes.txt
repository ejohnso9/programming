Possible problem with challenge #240

From Steven Jackson (Jackon?)
In another case of ambiguous but I guess still technically correct,
https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/240/ infuriated me for a good while. I looked
here for the definition http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MersenneNumber.html, realized that
didn't match up with the example output, and decided that maybe they meant Mersenne Prime,
which does match up with the examples output. I was actually pulling together references
to dispute the correctness of the test cases when I read http://oeis.org/A000225 (which
was referenced by wolfram) a bit more closely, and followed the link to
http://oeis.org/A001348. Really long story short: use http://oeis.org/A001348 as the
definition of Mersenne Number. I'm sure there are others I've blocked from memory, I'll
write up anything I remember.
