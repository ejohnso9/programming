Let's try to get through at least: "Chatper 0: The Function"

# literal set:
suits = set('CDHS')
{'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}  # card suits: clubs, diamonds, ...


"Cardinality"
    the length or size of a set
    |S|
    |suits| # is 4

"Catesian Product"
    S x T
    let nums be: {1, 2, 3}
    suits x nums is: {C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, ...}
    |suits x nums| is: 12

"Function": a rule or relationship betwee input and output
    the output is also known as the "image" of the input
    the input is the "pre-image" of the output
    f(domain) -> range
    Also sometimes known as a "mapping" (lens model)
    "q maps to r": q |-> r  (or: q -> r)  (pg 3)
    Note that a function can have multiple inputs (of course)...
        mult(x, y)
            (1, 1) -> 1
            (1, 2) -> 2
            (2, 2) -> 4
            (2, 3) -> 6
            ...
    "Image of q under f": f(q)
    "q maps to r under f": r = f(q)

    The notation: f: D -> F
        "f is a function mapping the domain D to the co-domain F"
        NB: "Note that one has some leeway in choosing the co-diomain
        since not all of tis members need be outputs." (pg 3)

        Let 'R' here mean the "script" symbol for the reals.

        e.g., cos: R -> R
            of course, the range of cos is clamped to: [-1, 1]
