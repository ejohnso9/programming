This is just some of my own solutions to things like:

    * SPOJ
    * Kattis
    * ProjectEuler.net
    * CodeEval (now defunct)
    * CodeChef, CodeWars, Exercism, etc
    * Working out code examples to various books, etc.

It's a public repository - I can't stop you from looking here.
You're welcome to learn from my code, but I trust you will do your
own work and not upload my solutions as if they were your own!

Thanks!
