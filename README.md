This is just some of my own solutions to various programming
sites such as:
    * CodeEval (now defunct)
    * SPOJ
    * ProjectEuler.net
    * CodeWars.com
    * Kattis
    * etc.

It's a public repository - you're welcome to look here and learn from my
code (if you can) but I trust you will do your own work and not upload
my solutions as if they were yours.

Thanks!
