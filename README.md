This is just some of my own solutions to things like:
    * CodeEval (now defunct)
    * SPOJ
    * ProjectEuler.net
    * CodeChef, CodwWards, Exercism, etc

It's a public repository - I can't stop you from looking here. You're welcome
to learn from my code, but I trust you will do your own work and not upload
my solutions as if they were yours.

Thanks!
