DISCUSSION
    I thought I would add a few words on general approach...
At first I was thinking to use itertools.product() to just go over all
the possible 3-char lowercase keys: 'aaa', 'aab', ..., 'aaz', 'aba',
'abb', ..., 'abz', ..., 'zzz'.

    But the problem has basically already stated that an ASCII encoding
is being used, and crypt text is exclusively or-ed with the key. My
expectation is that the message is very likely to be exclusively
printable text, and nearly all characters. There might be a few
punctuation characters, parenthesis, braces, etc, but with the exception
of maybe CR and LF (ASCII chars 13 and 10 respectively), there probably
isn't going to be any chars in the control ranges (characters with
decimal code < 32).

    So, I can just look at every 3rd character and build a list of
letters that lead to either 0 or a minimal of characters decoded in
the < 32 range. This is not guaranteed to work, but seems like a
sensible starting point, noting that 3 * 26 is 78 while 26 ** 3 is
17576, a number more than 2 orders of magnitude greater.
