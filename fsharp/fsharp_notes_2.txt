2024, Late August... trying to restart this F# adventure...

The other file, 'fsharp_notes.fs' was intended to be F# source.
I don't think it really is, though parts of it are sort of in the
syntax.


I am working more diligently on getting through the Chris Smith Book,
"Programming F# 3.0"
The language is now up to version 8.0. At my level, nearly the whole
book wil still be applicable. One minor change to note is that you can
now index a list or string without the dot syntax.
    Previously...
    let s = "my string"
    s.[3] // would be 's'
    s[3]  // same thing, more regular syntax, now

// From the other file...

//
// run a simple F# script without compilation
//
// 1) put the following text into a file named 'hello.fsx'
printfn "Hello, World!"
// 2) Run it:
> dotnet fsi hello.fsx
Hello, World!
// SUCCESS!
New, full projects can be created with 'dotnet new ...'
There's two main ways to do that:
    1) convert the current directory into a project
        > dotnet new console -lang F#
    2) specify the name to create a new directory for the project
        // OLD: > dotnet new console -lang F# -name myNewProj
        // see also -o option
        //
        // 2024Aug28 I am now running F# version 8.0 on Windows 11.
        // Syntax has changed somewhat:
        > dotnet new console --language F# --name hello

You can get more help on 'dotnet new':
> dotnet new -h
> dotnet new console -h
