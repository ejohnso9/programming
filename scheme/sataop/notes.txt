    5 data types (each with a predicate func to test data with)
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    number      number?
    symbol      symbol?
    boolean     boolean?
    pair        pair?
    procedure   procedure?
                ; ALSO: string? list? vector? char? null? port?



    Tests
    ---------
    = < > <= >=  ; use w/ numbers
    (< 4 5) ; #t
    (<= 4 4) ; #t
    (>= 4 2) ; #f
    ; != is not an operator but you can...
    (not (= 4 5)) ; #t

    eq? ; symbol samenesss
    (eq? (car '(Garield cat)) 'cat) ; #f! 'Garfield !same symbol
    ; NB: constructed lists will be different, even it same data!
    ; when used with lists, this tests list identity!
    (eq? (cons 1 '(2 3) (cons 1 '(2 3)))  ; #f !!! two sep lists!

    eqv? ; can include numbers, symbols, booleans
    (eqv? '(1 2) '(1 2))  ; #t
    (eqv? (cons 'a '(b c d)) (cons 'a '(b c d))  ; #f  what's going on here?
    ; ChatGPT explained this as a subtle optimization where the
    ; interpreter can re-use literals (in the first case, above)

    equal?  ; for pairs, corresponding elements are testeted (i.e., this
            ; is looking at values, not list identity)

    ; narrower tests (i.e., ones that don't have to test their type) are
    ; generally more efficient than ones that do)
