This directory has a virtual env setup within it, as reccomended at:
    https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/

You should activate it before doing stuff in the 'flask' project, here
(i.e., this dir) (e.g., before installing flask)

    $ . .venv/bin/activate

to get out of venv environment, you can probably just:

    $ deactivate

I previously had a .venv dir in here. But the whole thing was being
managed by git - all the *.pyc for a whole Python installation. That is
totally not what I want.

I think I have it remove now and .gitignore updated at the
.../src/git/programming level.

Have to put back a .venv if you want one now.
