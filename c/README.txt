This directory is for general programming in the C language.

Needs to be organized into subdirectories mapping to different books,
really, but for now there is a simple hello.c source file that has basic
notes about how to get it running in MacOS environment.
Those notes should pretty well be applicable to Linux and something like
Windows Cygwin as well.
