I am trying to follow along with this video:
    # Low Level: You can learn assembly in 10 minutes
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S5KRJv-7RU

PythonAnywhere has 'as' and 'ld':

$ which as
/usr/bin/as
$ which ld
/usr/bin/ld

# to assemble:
$ as one.s -o one.o

# to link
$ gcc -o one one.o -nostdlib -static

# if you run that (with just _start defined), it is expected to crash.
# The key is that 'as' was invoked w/o error.


# The web page he is showing at 6:01 is:
