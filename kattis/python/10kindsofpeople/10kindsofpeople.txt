DESCRIPTION
    solution to Kattis problem:
        https://open.kattis.com/problems/10kindsofpeople

THOUGHTS / DISCUSSION
    The solution rate on this problem is low, which is why I decided to try it.
    That probably stems from the fact that a straight recursive solution will
    eat up a bunch of memory and Python will quit (crash), even after this:

    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000)

    One can get the same effect by using a list like a data stack and
    simply iterating to process each argument put on our own "stack".
